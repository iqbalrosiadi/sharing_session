# shinyapps-data-analyst
an Accio Repository for Data Analyst Team.

## What is Accio?
Accio is an R-Shiny based web application that allows users to download raw data directly from BigQuery. It is deployed on top of Albus platform.

## Why Accio?
Since R-Shiny is open source, it will not charge the license of a user account. It is different from Tableau which charges per user account with various licensing types (view, explorer, creator). Accio will only charge BigQuery costs that users pull. To conclude, we only pay as we use.

## How Accio works?
Basically, accio is a query builder. Input from the user is used to build the logic of the query (query string manipulation) to pull data. The generated query will result in an R dataframe. When users click the download button, R-Shiny will export it into csv. There are actually many ways to do this in R-Shiny and this tutorial gives you one of the basic examples (kindly please share to us if you have a better approach ðŸ˜Š).
